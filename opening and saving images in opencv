#written as a string, while the second parameter is the readed image using imrread function
cv2.waitKey() #waitkey allows to input information when image is open, by leaving it blank it just waits for any key to be pressed to close it
cv2.destroyAllWindows() #'destroyAllWindows’ closes all the open windows, failure to place this will cause your programme to hang.
